# ssh_print
#
# This script prints on an ssh server using lpr.
#
# This script will cat the file down an ssh connection, which will call the lpr
# command on the specified printer with any additional options you supply.
#
# Usage:
#
# % serv_print SERVER FILE [lpr opts]
#
# Example:
#
# % serv_print mh-247 report.pdf
#
# This copys the file report.pdf to the ssh server mh-247 (specified in your
# ~/.ssh/config file), and then calls 'lpr' on the remote machine to print that
# pdf out.

# make sure there are enough arguments.
