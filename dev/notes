# permissions

## chattr

`T` for home directory
`i` not good because can't create links, find alternative (chmod)

## chmod

line that made directory (seemingly) undeletable: `sudo chmod 2775 library`
    -   still might be useful, to delete: `chattr -a library`
    -   however, still want to find a way to give user who adds music power to
        delete
